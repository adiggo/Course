Recursive Decomposition: 
apply divide and conquer in parallel. 

Data Decomposition:
data structure with large amounts of similar data need to be processed. 

The key to an effective task decomposition is to ensure taks are sufficiently independent so that manage dependencies only take a small fraction of the program execution time.
Task decomposition:
actions are carried out to solve the problem;
whether these actions are independent

At first, try to identify as many taks as possible. Much easier to start with too many tasks and merge them later on than split few tasks;
In some case, each task corresponds to a distincet function call.   Define a taks for each function call leads to functional decomposition.
